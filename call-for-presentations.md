title: Call for Presentations
---

Curry On has two central goals.

1. Bringing industry and academia together to have an open conversation.
2. Exploring the intersection of <b><span class="green">programming</span></b> or <b><span class="green">programming languages</span></b> with <b><span class="green">emerging challenges in industry</span></b>, such as security, big data, or machine learning.

Talks can cover topics as varied as an academic idea applied to a surprising
problem domain in a real-world system, to something racy like "programming
language academia is irrelevant and here's why".

We give no firm guidelines on topics (go wild!), however we particularly seek
talks that can provoke thought and discussion, or even (more idealistically)
can elicit or encourage new ideas or change.

Areas of particular interest to the conference include:

- distributed systems/big data
- machine learning
- security
- concurrency
- types
- functional or logic programming
- databases
- compilers and virtual machines
- PL approaches to front-end development
- probabilistic programming
- next generation tooling

## Format

Each accepted talk will get a 40 minute talk slot.

## Deadlines

- **<span class="white">Call for presentations closes</span>**: Friday, April 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2015
