### Abstract 

QuickCheck was presented in the year 2000 at the Int. Conf on Functional Programming. A new innovative way of software testing by automatically generating test cases from properties. An elegant Haskell program used to test Haskell programs. The company Quviq started in 2006 to provide and maintain a commercial version of this tool in order to support large industrial customers that couldn’t possibly think of using QuickCheck for Haskell. In the telecommunication and automotive industry, QuickCheck is now used to test C code. QuickCheck shows to be more effective and more efficient than manual testing approaches. In this talk we will show how QuickCheck grew from invention to product and what obstacles one finds on the way when doing so.


### Bio

Thomas Arts co-founder and CTO of Quviq has an academic background with a PhD in “Term Rewriting”. Directly after his PhD, Thomas has worked at Ericsson’s computer Science Lab, where he worked on verification tools for Erlang. After a short return to academia as professor at Chalmers, he is now fully devoted to amazing testing tools. Quviq is the company that productified QuickCheck, a tool that automatically generates tests. The tool is written in Erlang, but can be used to test systems written in a variety of languages. Among other successes, it is heavily used within the telecom and automotive industry, for example for testing 5G base stations and AUTOSAR standard software.
