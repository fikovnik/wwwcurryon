### Abstract 

Functional Reactive Programming was a thing that happened in the 90s. We’ve been rehashing these ideas, usually not even getting them right, for the past 20 years, and very little has happened to advance the state of the art.

Very little, but that’s still something. We’re going to explore some of the advances we’ve made recently, with a particular focus on PureScript and the Halogen library, introducing concepts such as signal functions to improve the composability and type safety of UI components.

### Bio

Bodil is a compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and is a co-organiser of multiple developer conferences in Scandinavia and the UK, mostly because she’s still learning how to stop. She is a prolific contributor to the Free Software community, and has recently taken up designing new programming languages as a hobby.
