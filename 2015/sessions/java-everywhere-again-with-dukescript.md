### Abstract

In this session you’ll learn how to manage development costs and cost of
ownership for cross-platform single-source applications that run on Desktop,
Apple iOS, Google Android and embedded devices using NetBeans HTML for Java
APIs. Applications are written in Java allowing you to use the same rock solid
language on client and server. Client and server can even share the same
business code. NetBeans HTML/Java APIs declaratively bind views defined in
HTML and Knockout.JS to Java ViewModels, allowing an absolutely clean
separation of Design and Development. You can use any Knockout.js components
unmodified in your app. And we'll demonstrate how easy it is to integrate
third-party widgets or create your own component suite.
