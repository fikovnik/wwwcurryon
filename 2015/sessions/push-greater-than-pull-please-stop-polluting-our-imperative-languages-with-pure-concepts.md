### Abstract

The past few years have seen an influx of ideas from functional programming languages to mainstream languages. Not only lambdas and higher-order functions have found their way into Java and other languages, but even more advanced concepts like monads, imported from the purest of FP languages. In this talk we’ll explore the validity and applicability of those concepts to imperative languages (or, rather, lack thereof), and the motivation for their inclusion. In particular, we’ll discuss:

1. Push and pull are duals, but pull is always better (in imperative languages).
2. We already have native syntax for (the important) monads.
3. How monads ruin imperative code.
4. Keep your monad transformers, we’ve got ThreadLocal
5. Why is this happening in the first place? Can we do better?
