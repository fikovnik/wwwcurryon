### Bio

I am a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, Cambridge, where I manage Programming Principles and Tools. As a part-time position, I also hold the Chair in Computer Security and am a member of the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science and the Security and Privacy group in the School of Informatics in the University of Edinburgh. I convene the University of Edinburgh Microsoft Research Joint Initiative in Informatics. I participate in the Data Science PhD programme. My current research is on probabilistic programming for machine learning.
