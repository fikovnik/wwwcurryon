### Abstract 

One useful application of static program analysis is editor assistance. For static languages, features like autocompletion, finding definitions, and hinting function argments are widely used. Itâ€™d be nice to have them for dynamic languages. Tern implements a type inference engine for JavaScript. It can be plugged into various editors to provide language-aware integration. To be able to do this in near real-time, it uses an optimized form of data-flow analysis. The analysis is far from sound, but immensely helpful regardless.
