### Abstract 

In software engineering, Conway’s Law states that the design of a system will mirror the structure of the teams building it. In other words, art imitates life. One might ask, then, if the reverse might also be true? In this talk, we’ll consider how, and to what extent, the design of software might impact scientific thinking. Could the decision to choose one programming language versus another influence more than what libraries are available and how easy it will be to hire developers? If so, might the business of software have more to offer science than just a faster calculator?

### Bio

Joshua Ballanco was originally trained as a chemist, but graduate school saw him progress through biochemistry, genetics, and bioinformatics before finally settling on evolutionary biology. Along the way, he also got a job writing bits of OS X server for Apple in Cupertino, CA. Eventually, he finished his Ph.D. thesis work by constructing a simulation in Ruby (really!). He has since worked for software companies both large and small, on web development, mobile apps, and scientific software. Currently he works remotely from Ankara, Turkey where he lives with his wife and young son.
