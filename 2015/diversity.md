### Eligibility

Applicants should be **both**:

1. a member of an underrepresented group in tech; women, LGBT, African, Hispanic, people with disabilities, or other underrepresented groups not listed.
2. unable to attend without some financial assistance. 

In an effort to stretch our scholarship funds as far as possible, we have a preference for European applicants.

### Award

Scholarship recipients will receive a free registration ticket. Curry On registration includes breakfast, lunch, coffee breaks, and the Curry On party on July 6th. In cases of need, applicants may optionally request assistance for travel and hotel. However, we note that as a first-time event, our budget is very limited, and we may thus be unable to accommodate the full budget requested  by each awardee.

### Application

Please fill in the form below to apply for the Curry On Diversity Scholarship. All application information will be kept confidential. The deadline for applications is June 5 2015. Recipients will be notified on June 9 2015 and must confirm attendance by June 12.

All attendees are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](http://curry-on.org/code-of-conduct.html).

We need your help! If you are interested in supporting the scholarship program as an individual, please let us know! If you are interested in supporting the program as a company or non-registered individual, please contact [heather@curry-on.org](mailto:heather@curry-on.org).
