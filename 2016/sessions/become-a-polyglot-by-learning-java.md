### Abstract

In a world running at breakneck speed to embrace JavaScript, it is refreshing to
see a project that embraces Java to provides solution that deal with the new
world and even improve it. I describe Truffle, a project that aim to build
multi-language, multi-tenant, multi-threaded, multi-node, multi-tooling and
multi-system environment on top of Java virtual machine with the goal to form
the fastest and most flexible execution environment on the planet! Learn about
Truffle and its Java API to become real polyglot, use the best language for a
task and never ask again: Do I really have to use that crummy language?

Jaroslav Tulach is the founder and initial architect of NetBeans, which is not
just a well known IDE, but also the first modular desktop application framework
written in Java. I have seen, made and helped to recover from many API design
mistakes. Such experiences forced me to write a book titled “Practical API
Design”. These days I am helping OracleLabs to design the API of Truffle which
is the fastest virtual machine on the planet.

### Bio

I am the founder and initial architect of NetBeans, which is not just a well
known IDE, but also the first modular desktop application framework written in
Java. My name sounds Slavic and has a strange pronunciation (read the initial J
as Y and last ch as in Scottish loch or in German Bach), because I am Czech.
However, as NetBeans has been the flagship software product of Sun and Oracle
for a while now, you don’t have to worry that content of the TheAPIBook might
not be widely applicable and understandable.

Maintaining NetBeans Platform, its architecture and APIs has always been the
primary focus of Jaroslav. During more than fifteen years of participating in
the NetBeans.org project, Jaroslav has seen, made and helped to recover from
many design mistakes. Such experience obligated Jaroslav to sit down and
summarize it.
