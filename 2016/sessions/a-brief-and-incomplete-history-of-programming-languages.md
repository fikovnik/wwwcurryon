### Abstract

Why do programming languages look the way they do today? How did it all started?
In this talk we will go over a brief history of programming languages, from the
very early days. We will go over greatest hits from Hilbert, Turing, Church,
Hopper and more.

### Bio

I really enjoy finding different ways to write code, sometimes for performance,
other times for succinctness, sometimes, just because you can, there is no
better way to learn than trying.

When I am not working I tend to play with Haskell or other languages or cats

Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so I try to help when I
can to make them happen. For that reason I co-organise Functional Kats and
GameCraft. I also speak at local and international conferences like CodeMesh,
Progressive.Net, ProF#, Lambda Days and many more.
