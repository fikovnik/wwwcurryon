### Abstract

The Stateless Service design principle has become ubiquitous in the tech
industry for creating horizontally scalable services. However our applications
do have state, we just have moved all of it to caches and databases. Today as
applications are becoming more data intensive and request latencies are expected
to be incredibly low, weâ€™d like the benefits of stateful services, like data
locality and sticky consistency. In this talk I will address the benefits of
stateful services, how to build them so that they scale, and discuss distributed
and scalable services in the real world that implement these techniques
successfully.
