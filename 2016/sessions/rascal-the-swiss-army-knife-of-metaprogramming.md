### Abstract

Meta programs are programs that consume other programs as input. There are many
tools for solving meta programming tasks, like grep and AWK for the simple
stuff, and parser generators or compiler-compilers for more complex tasks.
Rascal is a functional programming language that addresses all meta programming
concerns in a single, unified language. The use cases for Rascal range from
computing source code metrics and automated code smell detection, to
implementing refactorings and full-blown compilers. Rascal provides an
integrated set of features to simplify such source code analysis and
transformation tasks, including built-in context-free grammars for syntax
definition, constructs for automated traversal of syntax trees, powerful pattern
matching primitives, and domain-specific data types. In this talk I will provide
an overview of the language, and illustrate how it can be used as a tool for
source code analysis and as a language workbench for developing domain-specific
languages (DSLs).

### Bio

Tijs van der Storm is researcher at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CW), the
Dutch national institute for computer science and mathematics and teaches
Software Construction at the Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA). In his work he
tries to solve software engineering problems through better language design and
language engineering. He is one of the designers of the Rascal language. Apart
from all that, he likes literature and hates ugly code.
