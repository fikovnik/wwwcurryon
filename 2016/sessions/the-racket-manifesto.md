### Abstract

The creation of a programming language calls for guiding principles that point
the developers to goals. I spell out the three basic principles behind the
20-year development of Racket. First, programming is about stating and solving
problems, and this activity normally takes place in a context with its own
language of discourse; good programmers ought to formulate this language as a
programming language. Hence, Racket is a programming language for creating new
programming languages. Second, by following this language-oriented approach to
programming, systems become multi-lingual collections of interconnected
components. Each language and component must be able to protect its specific
invariants. In support, we offer protection mechanisms to implement a full
language spectrum, from C-level bit manipulation to soundly typed extensions.
Third, because Racket considers programming as problem solving in the correct
language, Racket must also turn extra-linguistic mechanisms into linguistic
constructs, especially mechanisms for managing resources and projects. I
explains these principles and how Racket lives up to them, presents the
evaluation framework behind the design process, and concludes with a sketch of
imperfections and opportunities for improvements.

### Bio

Matthias Felleisen, a Trustee Professor at Northeastern University’s College of
Computer Science, has spent 30 years exploring programming languages and the
pedagogy of software development. After receiving his PhD at Indiana University
in 1987, he launched his academic career at Rice University; in 2001, he moved
to Northeastern.

For the first decade of his career, Felleisen developed a new theoretical
framework for modeling programming languages. Over time, this framework has
provided the most widely used technique for proving type soundness theorems, the
fundamental correctness claims for programming languages.

In 1995, Felleisen launched two related projects: (1) a K-12 outreach project
with the goal of synthesizing mathematics and programming education and (2) the
Racket language design project in support of the outreach project. Felleisen and
his team taught dozens of intensive 5-day teacher training workshops over 20
years, focusing on program design as systematic problem solving. Working with
Northeastern undergraduates, they also created the Bootstrap curriculum for
middle schools; the curriculum has been adopted by code.org. The team’s Racket
programming language has become a test bed for language design ideas from mixins
to frameworks for domain-specific languages, from software contracts to gradual
typing systems, and from web programming disciplines to distributed
interactions. It is used in many applications, from DoD software to Naughty
Dog’s games.

For his research on programming languages, Felleisen was inducted as an ACM
Fellow in 2006 and received ACM SIGPLAN’s Achievement Award in 2012. Also in
2012, his paper on contracts for higher-order languages was picked asthe most
influential ICFP 2002 publication. Felleisen has delivered keynote addresses at
many programming language conferences, including POPL, ECOOP, and ICFP. For his
educational outreach, ACM honored Felleisen with the Karl V. Karlstrom Award in
2010. ACM SIGCSE named Felleisen Outstanding Educator of the Year in 2011. In
conjunction with the latter, he delivered the keynote at the annual Symposium on
Computer Science Education.
