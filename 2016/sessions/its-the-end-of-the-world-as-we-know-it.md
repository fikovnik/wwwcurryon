### Abstract

Perl can be a first computer language, but we try to think of it more as a last
computer language. Our philosophy, based on how natural language works, says
that a future-proof language should be flexible enough to evolve while providing
a rich cultural lexicon to discourage gratuitous use of that flexibility. Perl 5
has done okay with that approach over the years, but its design is starting to
run into its limits, as have the designs of various other popular languages.
Perl 6 is a grand experiment to see if we can transcend the limits of existing
languages, to create a new general-purpose, multi-paradigm language that could
serve not just as the next flavor-of-the-month language, but as a stable,
comfortable mother tongue for new generations of programmers. Come and see how
we’re doing on that so far.

### Bio

Larry Wall was educated at various places including the Cornish School of Music,
the Seattle Youth Symphony, Seattle Pacific University, Multnomah School of the
Bible, SIL International, U.C. Berkeley, and UCLA. Though trained primarily in
music, chemistry, and linguistics, Larry has been working with computers for the
last 40 years or so. He is most famous for writing rn, patch, and the Perl
programming language, but prefers to think of himself as a cultural hacker whose
vocation in life is to bring a bit of joy into the dreary existence of
programmers. For various definitions of “work for”, Larry has worked for Seattle
Pacific, MusiComedy Northwest, System Development Corporation, Burroughs,
Unisys, the NSA, Telos, ConTel, GTE, JPL, NetLabs, Seagate, Tim O’Reilly, the
Perl Foundation, Broadcom, and himself. He is currently serving as Artist in
Residence for craigslist.
