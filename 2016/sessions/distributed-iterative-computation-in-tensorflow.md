### Abstract

Deep learning is driving significant advances in Artificial Intelligence. In
this talk, I will describe the design and implementation of TensorFlow, the
Google platform for large-scale training of neural networks. The talk will focus
on one important aspect of the system: distributed execution of iterative
TensorFlow programs.
