### Abstract

This talk will introduce Oden, an experimental, statically typed, functional
programming language being built for the Go ecosystem. We will look at how Oden
aims to leverage the great features of Go — static linking, cross-compilation,
goroutines, channels and the great set of libraries and tools — and enable
higher-level abstractions, generics and a safer yet more flexible type system.

### Bio

After some years of musical education Oskar Wickström began his journey into the
world of software development as a self-taught programmer. He started a company
practicing web design and development for small businesses. He now works with
software analysis and repository mining at Empear, along with various open
source projects on his free time.

Among the technical topics that interest Oskar are functional programming,
systems design and programming languages. His more aestetic side, which mostly
involves making music, draws him towards graphics and UI design every now and
then. He’s a bit of a restless soul, but it also means he gets a lot done.
