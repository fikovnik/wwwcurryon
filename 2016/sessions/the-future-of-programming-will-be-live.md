### Abstract

Live programming aims to provide programmers with useful continuous feedback
from a live executing program. Realizing the “useful” part is not easy:
automatic re-execution and even time travel debugging do not significantly
augment the general abstract reasoning that makes programming hard. This talk
show how lessons learned from research on direct manipulation; example-centric,
conversational, learnable, and visual programming; live coding; and even
Hollywood’s fictional interfaces, can help us envision and design amazing new
programming experiences.

### Bio

I am a programming language researcher at Microsoft Research Asia’s Systems
Research Group who focuses on design, objects, IDEs, live programming, and how
we could program with touch.
