### Abstract

Having programmers do data science is terrible, if only everyone else were not
even worse. The problem is of course tools. We seem to have settled on either: a
bunch of disparate libraries thrown into a more or less agnostic IDE, or some
point-and-click wonder which no matter how glossy, never seems to truly fit our
domain once we get down to it. The dual lisp tradition of grow-your-own-language
and grow-your-own-editor gives me hope there is a third way.

This talk is a meditation on the ideal environment for doing data science and
how to (almost) get there. I will cover how I approach data problems with
Clojure (and why Clojure in the first place), what I believe the process of
doing data science should look like and the tools needed to get there. Some
already exists (or can at least be bodged together); others can be made with
relative ease (and we are already working on some of these); but a few will take
a lot more hammock time.

### Bio

Built my first computer out of Lego bricks and learned to program soon after.
Emergence, networks, modes of thought, limits of language and expression are
what makes me smile (and keeps me up at night). Currently working at GoOpti
making the company data-driven; setting up our analytics infrastructure (end
goal: provide any answer stemming from data in 2 min or less); and building our
predictive-real time-superduper pricing engine.
