### Abstract

Abstract interpretation (AI) is a technique developed in the 1970s as a
framework to formalize sound approximation of program execution. AI has had an
impact on commercial and academic static analysis, and as a technique has
recently seen a resurgence. This talk will give a brief history of AI,
demonstrate some recent advancements in the field, and ask and hopefully not
answer deep philosophical questions regarding the line between abstract and
concrete.

### Bio
