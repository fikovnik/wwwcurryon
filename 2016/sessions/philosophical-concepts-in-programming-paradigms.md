### Abstract

Object oriented programming argues objects are fundamental to our understanding
of computer programs. Abstract objects and their instances are the base of our
Ontology, since Plato, and this way to see the world seems to be in sync with
folk intuition. Functional programming, on the other hand, argues objects are an
illusion and that every operation creates a completely new state of your
application, like in Heraclitus’ famous quote, Descartes’ ever-recreating God
and Whiteheads’s process philosophy. Let’s learn some history to avoid repeating
it.

### Bio
