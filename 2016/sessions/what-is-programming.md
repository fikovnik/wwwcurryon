### Abstract

As developers we're so deeply involved with programming that we rarely ask
ourselves about what this activity consists of. Plato argued that the best in
any craft would not only know what to do from experience, but be able to explain
why they do as they do. Following his advice, I'll take a step back and
investigate the nature and complexity of this activity and some analogies (some
of them somewhat metaphisically charged, like "objects") we commonly use to
explain it.

### Bio

Developer and philosopher. In the industry since the last millennium. Currently
working mainly building interfaces with functional techniques.
