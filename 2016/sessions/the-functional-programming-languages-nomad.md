### Abstract

I have used functional programming in industrial projects since 1998; starting
with a stage lighting system, which is still in use. I wrote it while still a
research assistant. While I have a strong attachment to Scheme - I was project
editor for the R6RS standard - I also use Racket, OCaml, Scala, Clojure, Erlang,
F#, Haskell, and Star in a wide variety of projects from social pedagogy to
semiconductor fab control.

My work continually force me to question if I am still on the path to correct,
effective, and maintainable software. Time and again, functional approaches won
out, and failures hid in the imperative and OO parts of my projects.
Consequently, the journey from academic research to industrial applications also
ironically marks a journey away from imperative objects towards functional
purity. (Static types, not so much, however.) The talk is a tour through my
industrial projects, I encourage you mine them for insights on how to write and
not to write software.

### Bio

I am CTO of Active Group.

We do most of our software development using functional programming.
