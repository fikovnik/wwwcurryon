### Abstract

Programming languages are an interface between people and computers. Many have
explored one side or the other. In this talk, I will illustrate the insights
that can be gained by exploring both. For example, I will show how understanding
human behavior can solve undecidable problems, and how understanding
mathematical models can predict human expectations. I will discuss how this work
was inspired by and adopted by the Ceylon design team at Red Hat and the Kotlin
design team at JetBrains.
