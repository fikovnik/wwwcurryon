### Abstract

Functional programmers love to discuss Monads, their metaphors, and their many
use cases. Recognizing that monadic design and development patterns have their
place, this talk will discuss the price of implementing the Free Monad in your
code - spoiler alert - it's not free.

The Free Monad’s basis in Category Theory hails from a highly academic look at
mathematics and functional programming, but this talk will prove you don't have
to have a PhD to understand and apply these concepts. We’ll define the building
blocks of the abstraction by discussing the practical use cases, trade-offs, and
alternative patterns using real Scala code. Let’s have a conversation about code
complexity and the benefits and disadvantages of applying highly theoretical
concepts into an industry application.
