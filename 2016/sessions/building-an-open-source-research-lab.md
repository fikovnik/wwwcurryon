### Abstract

When I joined Mozilla as a full-time employee in 2010, I knew I wanted to
combine technology research with Mozilla’s open source culture to serve our
mission of advancing the Web platform. I also knew I had no idea how to do it.
So I cofounded Mozilla Research to experiment with ways of doing innovation with
open source.

Fast forward to 2016, and we have a number of exciting technologies we’ve
spearheaded or collaborated on, including asm.js, WebAssembly, Emscripten,
AOMedia Video, Rust, and Servo. We’ve also made our share of mistakes, and tried
to extract lessons from them.

In this talk, I will recount some of my experiences running an open source
research lab, and talk about how I’ve come to believe that investing in open
source communities is a unique and powerful tactic for advancing the state of
our understanding of software.

### Bio

working to expand the foundations of the Open Web. I participate in a number of
Web platform projects, including:
