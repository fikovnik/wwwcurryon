### Abstract

Back in the 1940s, the French writer Raymond Queneau wrote a book titled
Exercises in Style featuring 99 renditions of the exact same short story, each
in a different style. This talk, based on a book with the same name, shamelessly
does the same for a simple program. From monolithic to object-oriented to
continuations to relational to publish/subscribe to monadic to aspect-oriented,
and much more. You will get a tour through the richness of human computational
thought by through the lens of one, simple, program in many different guises.

More than an academic exercise; this about freedom of expression. Iâ€™ll argue
that you are in dangers of getting trapped into a single prescribed style during
your professional career, and the understanding all is needed to truly
understand how to architect large-scale systems.
