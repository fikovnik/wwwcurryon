### Abstract

The need to analyze massive scientific data sets on the one hand and the
availability of distributed compute resources with an increasing number of CPU
cores on the other hand have promoted the development of a variety of languages
and systems for parallel, distributed data analysis.

In this talk we argue that both integrating existing tools and libraries and
expressing complex workflows in a functional programming model is a necessity in
contemporary languages for distributed computing.

We demonstrate the usefulness of these features by the example of Cuneiform, a
minimal functional language for large-scale scientific data analysis running on
the Erlang VM. We discuss applications in bioinformatics and machine learning.
