### Abstract

The ultimate goal of all computer science is the program. In the beginning, so
our myths and stories tell us, the programmer created the program from the
eternal nothingness of the void. These notes have the status of letters written
to ourselves: we wrote them down because, without doing so, we found ourselves
making up new arguments over and over again. In 2002 at the first OOPSLA Onward
track, James Noble and Robert Biddle presented a paper entitled “Notes on
Postmodern Programming”. The paper was a both a paean, a homage to the love of
programming and its lore, but also a mocking attack. One common question was
whether the paper was serious or a joke? It was both, and that was the agenda.
In following years, similar papers were presented, with diminishing impact: the
shock of the new wears off. In this retrospective, we revisit some of the
propositions made in the early papers, and attempt to re-experience the shock.
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot, but we’ll remember with advantages what
feats we did that day.
