### Abstract

One of the biggest changes in the transition from Objective-C to Swift is the
new type system. This change is at the heart of Swift’s language design, from
optionals over value types to constrained generics, and to truly understand the
language, a thorough understanding of its type system is indispensable. In this
talk, I will explain the advantages of Swift’s strong commitment to a
sophisticated type system. I will illustrate the impact on language and program
design through a series of examples, drawn from my experience of developing one
of the first Swift-based applications published in the Mac App Store. I will
discuss why type-driven design benefits from functional programming principles,
and also, how it enables us to write less tests without a loss of confidence in
our code.

### Bio

Manuel M T Chakravarty is an Associate Professor at the University of New South
Wales. His core research interests are functional programming, novel compiler
technology, and high-performance computing. He graduated from the University of
Karlsruhe and received a doctoral degree from the Berlin Institute of
Technology. His major contributions include work on Haskell’s foreign function
interface, the C->Haskell binding generator, the theory and implementation of
type families in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and the development of multiple
systems for data parallel programming of multicore CPUs and GPUs, including
Accelerate, Data Parallel Haskell, and Repa. He is the principal author of the
interactive development environment Haskell for Mac and he is excited by the
opportunities presented by the Swift programming language. Most importantly, he
believes in the fruitful combination of theory and practice.
