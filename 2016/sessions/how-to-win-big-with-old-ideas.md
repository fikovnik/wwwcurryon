### Abstract

From both an academic and industrial perspective Clojure programmers are living
in the computational stone age. Lisp (1957), tries (1965), and Datalog (1977)
form the working day conceptual foundation for many professional Clojure
engineers. Paradoxically Clojure programmers leverage these cobweb infested
ideas to successfully target two of the most pervasive and active industry
technology platforms - the Java Virtual Machine and JavaScript. While many
mainstream developers continue to bicker over the finer points of MVC, Clojure
developers are building complex client user interfaces with functional
programming and immutable data structures at the core. While academics forge
ahead with ever more sophisticated forms of verification, Clojure programmers
build robust and compelling systems with hardly more type safety than the
earliest Lisp implementation. Perhaps good ideas never grow old and Clojure can
show us that better software is often a matter of looking back to the future.
