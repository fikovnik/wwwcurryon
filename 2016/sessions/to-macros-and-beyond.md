### Abstract

Scala has transformed in a big way when it got macros in early 2013. Very soon
after their introduction, macros spread like wildfire, and now they are used in
many major libraries in the Scala community. Why such a sudden success? Can
macros be useful to your language? Come join us to learn from our experiences
and see what weâ€™re planning for future versions of Scala.

### Bio

Eugene Burmako is a last-year PhD student from EPFL, working on the academic
side of the Scala language team. During his time at EPFL, Eugene created Scala
macros and delivered them to the production compiler. These days, along with
maintaining reflection and macros, Eugene works on scala.meta, a general-purpose
metaprogramming toolkit for Scala.
