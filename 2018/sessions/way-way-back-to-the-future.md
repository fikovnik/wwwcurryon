### Abstract

Newton said that if he had seen further than others it was because he was standing on the shoulders of giants. By contrast, much of the history of computing since 1980 seems to be computerists standing on each other's toes! 60 years ago, one of our most brilliant and far reaching giants had a number of deep ideas that were of vital importance then, and are even more vitally important today.
