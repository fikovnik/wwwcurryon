### Abstract

It appears that there is a software complexity conspiracy seeking to make the development of even straightforward applications challenging.  To be successful today one needs to cope with the full-stack, and constantly changing collection of languages, apis, runtimes, tools and frameworks.  The different levels of maturity and quality require that developers learn by trial and error.  The sheer volume of APIs is daunting. Complexity begets complexity! Yet applications for the most part are not complicated.  
We argue that hardware enables simplicities in software.  That modern applications donâ€™t need to be as complicated as they are. We examine application domains to illustrate the value of an  approach we call collection oriented programming.
