### Abstract

Elixir is a modern programming language built for concurrency, robustness, and maintainability. Although the Elixir team came from &quot;industry&quot; backgrounds, the history of Elixir is full of cases where the team has reached for existing research in order to solve problems arising with the language. For example, we based our implementation of a code formatter on a series of papers on pretty printing and formatting code. In this talk, I'd like to go share our learnings and experiences as a bunch of industry folks getting help from academia to approach and tackle real-world problems and come up with real-world solutions.

### Bio

Andrea is a human born in the ancient lands of central Italy. He loves functional programming, beautiful code, and learning stuff. He's a software architect, speaker, and member of the core team of the Elixir programming language. His weak spot is having red hair.
