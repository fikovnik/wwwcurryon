### Abstract

Luna is a visual-textual programming language with a novel approach to functional programming. We demonstrate how purely functional programming can be handled visually and how it is conveniently representable in the form of a computation graph. We present the challenges and lessons learnt while implementing the whole Luna ecosystem in Haskell. Since the main target for Luna is data processing, we present interactive examples and discuss how it can change the way data is being processed across industries.
