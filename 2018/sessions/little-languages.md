### Abstract

Countless Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) have been created and used for more than four decades. Today, creating a DSL from scratch is still surprisingly hard work. To understand why and what we can do about it, we will first look at a historical overview of DSLs. Then we will explain why DSLs have great value in industry today and discuss the practical hurdles faced when developing a new DSL. We will finish off with some suggestions on how industry and academia could collaborate in the development of Little Language Nurseries.
