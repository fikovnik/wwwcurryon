### Abstract

Little Languages, also known as Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), can be characterized as having a simple grammar, offering high level abstractions, allowing for hierarchical factoring of solutions, reducing the solution space, and allowing us to develop the tools that matter. In this talk, Chris will provide a historical of two dozen influential Little Languages, including some he worked on himself, and highlight their unique approach to solving a given problem.
