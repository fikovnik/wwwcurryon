### Abstract

Go is a fairly new language that is heavily inspired by the languages that preceded it. In this talk I’ll share: 
1. What features we included in Go, their inspiration, and why we included them
2. What we deliberately left out of Go and why
3. The lessons we’ve learned and what we would have done differently.
