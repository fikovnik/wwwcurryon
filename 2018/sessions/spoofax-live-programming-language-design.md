### Abstract

Programming language design requires many iterations to get right. Building the tools to use and evaluate a design is an important cost factor. In this talk I discuss and demonstrate the Spoofax language workbench, its high-level declarative meta-languages for the definition of syntax and semantics of programming languages, and the live generation of programming environments from those definitions.
