### Abstract

Creating User Interfaces has traditionally been a mostly imperative matter and building UIs in a functional way has never really been easy. In this talk weâ€™ll learn how to build UIs using only pure functions with the help of Reactive Programming and Scala.js or PureScript. We will take a look at the strengths and weaknesses of each languages, explore OutWatch, a new UI Library based on Rx, look at what works well, identify more challenging tasks and unlock the full potential of functional design and type safety with functional programming in the browser.
