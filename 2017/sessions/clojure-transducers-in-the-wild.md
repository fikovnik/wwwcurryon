### Abstract

Transducers is a powerful functional abstraction included with Clojure. They are generally faster, more reusable and composable than the core functions for collection processing. We used them extensively in our projects and we learned a few lessons, including how to test and debug them. The talk, after a quick introduction to the concept, presents a few examples and best practices.

### Bio

I started programming professionally around 2000. I've done work/research for different industries, corporate and startups and got interested in Clojure sometime in 2010. I'm author of &quot;Clojure Standard Library Annotated Reference&quot; book and the &quot;Clojure Pills&quot; screencast series on Youtube. I currently work at uSwitch in London.
