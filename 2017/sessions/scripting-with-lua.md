### Abstract

The main benefits offered by a programming language are not only what it
allows us to do, but also what it prevents us from doing. This conflict
makes it hard for a single language to fulfil all needs of a large
software project.

Scripting emphasizes the construction of software using two different
languages; a system? language for the hard parts and a scripting
language for the soft parts.  This mix allows the development of
programs that combine the qualities of both languages, such as
performance and flexibility.  Scripting is hardly a new idea;
nevertheless, few languages have been designed with real scripting in
mind.

Unlike most other dynamic languages, Lua is a language that has been
designed from inception to be used as a scripting language. It is the
leading scripting language in games. It is also widely used in embedded
systems such as set-top boxes, routers, telecom equipment, and mobiles.

In this talk we will cover the most distinguishing features of Lua,
emphasizing its trade-offs as a scripting language, the prominence of
simplicity and small size in its design, and its use of a few simple but
powerful concepts as unifying mechanisms.

### Bio

Roberto Ierusalimschy is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at
PUC-Rio (the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro), where
he works with programming-language design and implementation. He is the
