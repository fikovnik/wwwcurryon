### Abstract

There is no greater joy than programming using a simple expressive language with
a clear syntax and semantics. Lisp, Smalltalk, Haskell, Prolog, Unix pipes/Bash,
Erlang, are likely the most well-known of such languages.  Typically, such
languages achieve their consistency and power by taking a strong position with
respect to syntax and semantics.  Hence each is often sighted as learn Lisp |
Scheme | Racket or Haskell to understand functional programming; learn Smalltalk
to understand objects; Erlang to understand concurrent
programming/micro-services.

However, oneâ€™s computational experiences are in my opinion incomplete without
exploring the world Vector programming, (also called Array programming) inspired
by APL and followed by NIAL, J and k.  In this talk we look at array
programming; idioms; and most importantly vector thinking which enable concise
expression efficient solutions.

Dave is a popular, humorous, albeit opinionated keynote speaker with an
impressive breadth of business experience and technical depth. He is a thought
leader in large-scale software engineering and a founding director of the Agile
Alliance.

With close links the R&D community Dave is an adjunct research professor at
Carleton University in Canada and held past positions at UQ and QUT in
Australia. He has been a business and technical advisor to many technology
companies including Kx Systems.

Dave is founder and chairman of the YOW! Australia and Lambda Jam conferences,
