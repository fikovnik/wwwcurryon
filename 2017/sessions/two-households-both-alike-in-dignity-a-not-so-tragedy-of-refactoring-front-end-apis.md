### Abstract

It can feel like a Shakespearean tragedy having to deal with technical debt when starting feature work - especially when the debt was accrued from a pair of star-crossed lovers - two teams working in parallel. Based on her recent work adding Apple Pay support to perk itemization at Indiegogo, Julia Nguyen will be talking about accounting for technical debt in feature work and best practices in refactoring front-end APIs.
