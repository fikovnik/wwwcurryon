### Abstract

Memory issues can be a black box often thrown over the fence for the most senior level developers to solve. For newer developers it seems like all of a sudden, your app is failing and you're seeing red everywhere. You've optimized your database queries but are still running into issues. What does this all mean? How do you figure out what's going on without solely passing it off to someone else? You'll walk away from this talk with an understanding of what memory allocation means and the tools you can use to assess what's happening.
