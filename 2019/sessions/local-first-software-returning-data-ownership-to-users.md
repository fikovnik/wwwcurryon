### Abstract

Cloud applications such as Google Docs are popular because they enable real-time collaboration with colleagues, and they make it easy for us to access our work from all of our devices. However, by centralizing data storage on servers, cloud apps also take away ownership and agency from users. If a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data created with that software is lost. However, collaboration and data ownership needn’t be at odds with each other. This talk introduces “local-first software”, a set of principles and technologies for software that retain the advantages of the cloud, while also returning data ownership to end users. Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline, cross-device collaboration, as well as improved security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data. This talk explores various technologies that partially satisfy the local-first principles, and discusses some local-first software prototypes we have created. While the local-first approach has many advantages, there are also challenges, since it is a new paradigm for application development. Our programming models and APIs need to change, we need to rethink some deeply ingrained assumptions, and we need to adapt user interfaces accordingly. Solving these challenges requires bringing together industrial software engineers and designers with researchers from the distributed systems, programming languages, databases, and HCI communities. At Curry On, we will start this process.

### Bio

Dr Martin Kleppmann is a researcher in distributed systems at the University of Cambridge, and author of the acclaimed “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” (O’Reilly Media, 2017). Previously he was a software engineer and entrepreneur at Internet companies including LinkedIn and Rapportive, where he worked on large-scale data infrastructure. He developed the concept of local-first in collaboration with the Ink&amp;Switch research lab.
