### Abstract

Microservice architectures have taken over the industry, and with the rise of cluster schedulers and serverless the envelope is being pushed even further. However while tools like microservices, containers, and schedulers were designed to solve problems associated with the systems of old, they introduce many others like API migrations, service dependencies, and deployment automation. In this talk we will explore these new challenges and see how curiously, these system-level concerns can be tackled with some inspiration from the programming languages community, viewing the world of microservices through the lens of type systems and language runtimes.

### Bio

Adelbert Chang is a Lead Data Engineer at Target where he works on deployment infrastructure for the Data Science and Optimization team. Previously he worked at U.C. Santa Barbara doing research in large-scale graph querying and modeling, and in industry on machine learning systems, rule engines, and developer tools. Recently he has been exploring the intersection of functional programming and system design. He is an active open source contributor, speaker, and writer for projects spanning the areas of functional programming, type systems, graph analysis, tooling, and infrastructure. He received his Computer Science degree through the College of Creative Studies at U.C. Santa Barbara in 2014.
