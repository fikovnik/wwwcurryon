### Abstract

You might have seen a few cool looking charts in various presentations about  Docker where you get a quick "Docker uses namespaces, cgroups, chroot, etc." to create containers. But why does it take all these pieces to create a contaienr? Why is it not a simple syscall and it's all done for me? In this talk, we will dispel the magic behind containers and write our own in Rust!
