### Abstract

Plutus and Marlowe are two smart contract languages being developed by
IOHK for Cardano. Plutus is a library built on top of Haskell. Unique
among smart contract languages, Plutus uses metaprogramming to
integrate off-chain and on-chain code. On-chain code compiles to
Plutus Core, based on System F-omega, an unusual application of theory
to practice. Marlowe is a domain-specific language, based on the
financial contracts work of Peyton Jones, Eberd, and Seward. You can
