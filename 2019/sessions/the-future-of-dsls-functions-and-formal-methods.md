### Abstract

I have used domain-specific languages to empower non-programmers in
healthcare, finance, aerospace, automotive and public administration for
years. My approach relies on growing the DSL from a functional
programming core, combining the flexibility and power of an algorithmic
language with domain-specific constructs that range from temporal data
types, over decision tables, state machines and data models to
polymorphic dispatch between versions of calculation rules. I rely on
the open source MPS language workbench to define the languages and
a state-of-the-art IDE.

For the future, I am looking to incremental model transformations to
desugar domain-specific constructs back to a minimal core language in
realtime. That core language will have an interpreter for in-IDE
execution and a compiler for deployment. The language will be
integrated with formal methods to verify properties of programs,
enabling advanced analyses for DSL users.

In this talk, I will first demo some of the existing DSLs, provide an
illustration of how they are built today. Then I will demo prototypes of
the future approach and point out challenges that require work,
especially in the context of formal methods integration.


### Bio

Markus Voelter works as a language engineer, bridging the gap from
industry, business and science domains to software systems. He designs
user-friendly languages, implements analyses, tools and IDEs, and
architects backends based on interpreters and generators. He also works
on meta-tools for language engineering. Markus publishes papers and
books on the subject and regularly speaks at conferences world-wide.
Markus has a diploma in technical physics from FH Ravensburg-Weingarten
and a PhD in computer science from TU Delft.
