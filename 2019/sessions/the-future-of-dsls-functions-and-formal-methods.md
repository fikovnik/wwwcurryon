### Abstract

I have used domain-specific languages to empower non-programmers in healthcare, finance, aerospace, automotive and public administration for years. My approach relies on growing the DSL from a functional programming core, combining the flexibility and power of an algorithmic language with domain-specific constructs that range from temporal data types, state machines and data models to polymorphic dispatch between versions of calculation rules. I rely on the open source MPS workbench to define the languages and their IDE. I am looking to incremental model transformations to desugar domain-specific constructs back to a minimal core language in realtime. That core language will have an interpreter for in-IDE execution and a compiler for deployment. The language will be integrated with formal methods to verify properties of programs, enabling advanced analyses for DSL users. In this talk, I will demo some existing DSLs, provide an illustration of how they are built, and demo prototypes of the future approach while discussing their integration with formal methods.

### Bio

Markus Voelter works as a language engineer, bridging the gap from industry, business and science domains to software systems. He designs user-friendly languages, implements analyses, tools and IDEs, and  architects backends based on interpreters and generators. He also workson meta-tools for language engineering. Markus publishes papers and books on the subject and regularly speaks at conferences world-wide. Markus has a diploma in technical physics from FH Ravensburg-Weingarten and a PhD in computer science from TU Delft.
