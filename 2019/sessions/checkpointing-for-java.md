### Abstract

Java has evolved significantly in the past 20+ years. Users still want to
run highly scalable monolithic applications, but now they also want to run
 in the cloud with fast startup and a small footprint. Checkpointing will
 solve at least half of that problem.

 In this session, we'll show you how to checkpoint your Java application and
 then restore it on a different machineâ€”or several different machines. An
 application that might take minutes to warm up can be warmed up, garbage
collected, etc., and then checkpointed. Users can restore Java processes in
 ms. We'll also give an overview of CRIU (checkpoint restore in userspace) a
Linux utility that Java checkpointing is based on, present the proposed
Java API, and then discuss some interesting use cases.

### Bio

Christine H. Flood is a software developer at Red Hat working on OpenJDK.  She's committed 
to bringing new programming language design features to Java so that it remains relevant for 
another 20 years.
