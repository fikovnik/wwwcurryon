### Abstract

What do the topics of data center configuration, device drivers, cryptography, message parsers and protocols have in common? In  three words: logic and languages! In this talk, I’ll describe how Microsoft Research has developed and applied logic engines (such as Z3) and new languages (such as IVy and F*) to the specification, proof and testing of critical subsystems of Microsoft Azure.  F*, Ivy, and Z3 are all open source technologies (https://github.com/fstarlang, https://github.com/Microsoft/ivy, https://github.com/Z3Prover).

### Bio

Thomas (Tom) Ball is a principal researcher and manager at Microsoft Research. In 1999, He initiated the influential SLAM software model-checking project with Sriram Rajamani, which led to the creation of the Static Driver Verifier tool for finding defects in Windows device drivers. Tom is a 2011 ACM Fellow for ‘contributions to software analysis and defect detection’. As a manager, he has nurtured research areas such as automated theorem proving, program testing/verification and empirical software engineering. His current focus is the Microsoft MakeCode platform for programming with physical computers (www.makecode.com).
