### Abstract

Earlier this year, we announced WASI, the WebAssembly system interface. With this system interface, WebAssembly can be used outside the browser in a portable and safe way.

As Solomon Hykes, co-founder of Docker, said, "If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to create Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing."

But WASI will be useful for so many other use cases, too. In this talk, we'll explain how WASI works and explore how different use cases can benefit from it.

### Bio

Lin Clark makes code cartoons and is a Principal Research Engineer on Mozilla's Advanced Development team, focusing on WebAssembly and Rust.

Till Schneidereit directs the WebAssembly tooling and runtime, and the Rust efforts at Mozilla. His team is responsible for Mozilla’s contributions to the Rust programming language; driving the Rust to WebAssembly compilation efforts; the Cranelift WebAssembly code generator; the Wasmtime WebAssembly runtime; and other projects around WebAssembly development and deployment. He’s also a delegate to the language standardization bodies for both JavaScript and WebAssembly.
