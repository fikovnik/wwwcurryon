### Bio

Alastair Donaldson is a Software Engineer working in the Android Graphics Tools team at Google, where he leads the GraphicsFuzz project on automated graphics driver testing.  Alastair is also a Reader in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, which is where the research behind GraphicsFuzz originated; this research led to a start-up company (of the same name) that was acquired by Google in 2018.  His research and engineering work focuses on novel techniques and tools to support programming, testing and reasoning about highly parallel systems.  He was the recipient of the 2017 BCS Roger Needham Award and an EPSRC Early Career Fellowship, and has published 80+ articles on programming languages, formal verification, software testing and parallel programming.  Alastair was previously a Visiting Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond, an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford and a Research Engineer at Codeplay Software Ltd.  He holds a PhD from the University of Glasgow, and is a Fellow of the British Computer Society.
