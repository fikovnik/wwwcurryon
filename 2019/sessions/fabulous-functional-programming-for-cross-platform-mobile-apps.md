### Abstract

I will describe Fabulous, a thin framework for using functional programming to build cross-platform mobile apps using F#. I will look at the principles of Model-View-Update programming, their origin in Elm and Elmish, and how they differ from Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM).  I'll also describe opportunities for academic compiler research in this area.

### Bio

Don is an Australian computer scientist researcher working for Microsoft, based in London.  He is the BDFL for the F# programming language and contributes regularly to its design and tooling.
