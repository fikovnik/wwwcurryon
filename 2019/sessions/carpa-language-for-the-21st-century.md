### Abstract

The last few years have been exciting for programming languages enthusiasts. Rust freed us from the chains of garbage collection. Functional languages such as Haskell, Idris, and Agda have given us expressive type systems. Lisps come back into the mainstream consciousness, and they are bringing macros. In my talk “Carp: A Language for the 21st century” I want to introduce you to an exciting new programming language that aims to unify multiple branches of this development. Carp is a Lisp that combines macros, a modern type system, and an adaption of the Rust borrow checker to get rid of garbage collection. We will talk a bit about the ideas and concepts behind the language before diving into a playful hands-on demo, with the aim of empowering the audience to start working with Carp themselves. In a blatant disregard of conference best practices, there will be live-coding! To get our feet back on the ground afterwards, we will also take a brief and honest look at the state of the language and ecosystem, and cover how you could get involved!
