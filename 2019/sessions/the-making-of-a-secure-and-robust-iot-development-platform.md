### Abstract

Generic small IoT devices are cheap and computational powerful. However, we found that current software stacks and development tools make it hard to develop safe and robust applications. Lack of memory protection, limited resources, only a thin layer of operating system support and slow development cycles render IoT devices unattractive to programmers, stifling innovation. To address this vacuum, we have designed Toit, a new software platform that turns IoT devices into ‘real’ robust computers: easy to program, safe execution environment, flexible, upgradeable, and recoverable. My talk starts with motivating a new programming language and demonstrates how our platform makes IoT devices accessible to high-level programmers. I will conclude with a demo of Toit orchestrating a fleet of IoT devices.

### Bio

Lars Bak spent the last three decades designing and implementing object-oriented programming languages. His passion for this area started in 1986 when implementing a runtime system for BETA. Since then, Lars has left his mark on several software systems: Self, Strongtalk, JVM HotSpot, JVM CLDC HI, OOVM Smalltalk, V8, Dart, and lately Toit. In 2018, he received the Dahl-Nygaard prize for design and implementation of several object-oriented systems. Lars has a master’s degree in computer science at Aarhus University from 1988. Lars founded Toitware with Kasper Lund in in early 2018.
