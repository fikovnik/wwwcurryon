title: Call for Presentations
---

Curry On has two central goals.

1. Bringing industry and academia together to have an open conversation.
2. Exploring the intersection of <b><span class="green">programming</span></b> or <b><span class="green">programming languages</span></b> with <b><span class="green">emerging challenges in industry</span></b>, such as security, big data, or machine learning.

Talks can cover topics as varied as an academic idea applied to a surprising
problem domain in a real-world system, to something racy like "programming
language academia is irrelevant and here's why".

We give no firm guidelines on topics (go wild!), however we particularly seek
talks that can provoke thought and discussion, or even (more idealistically)
can elicit or encourage new ideas or change.

Areas of particular interest to the conference include:

- distributed systems/big data
- machine learning
- security
- concurrency
- types
- functional or logic programming
- databases
- compilers and virtual machines
- PL approaches to front-end development
- probabilistic programming
- next generation tooling

## Format

Each accepted talk will get a 40 minute talk slot.

There are two different sorts of talk slots. Presenters have a choice between:

- a _standard_ talk slot, or
- a _chess-timer_ talk slot.

(There will be a limited number of chess-timer talk slots.)

<h3 id="chesstimer_talks">Chess-Timer Talks</h3>

<p>One of Curry On's prime goals is to <b>bring industry and academia together
to have an open conversation.</b> But one speaker addressing hundreds of people
is hardly a conversation. So, we're changing that.</p>

<p>We also call ourselves "a new and unusual non-profit conference focused on
programming languages & emerging challenges in industry."</p>

<p><b>Chess-timer talks</b> are our unusual solution to making tech conferences a
more interactive, more fun, and better place for learning and discussions.</p>

<p>Chess-timer talks primarily seek to get more audience members participating in
the presentation. Speakers who choose to give a chess-timer talk are allowed
20 minutes of solo speaking time, and 20 minutes of discussion time. A Curry
On representative operates a chess-timer during the presentation, switching
between solo + discussion time budgets. When an audience member interrupts the
talk to ask a question, for example, we switch the timer to deduct from
discussion time. This style of giving talks has been demoed in small (20-30
person) academic workshops to great success. In those workshops, it has
incentivized speakers to strategically insert fodder for discussion points
into their presentations so as to try and elicit audience members to ask
questions.</p>

<p>Speakers with selected talks will have the opportunity to choose whether or
not they would like to give a chess-timer talk. Curry On will feature a
<i>limited number</i> of chess-timer sessions, meaning that a majority of talks
will still be standard conference talks.</p>
